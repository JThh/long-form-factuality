The leak released a mixture of toxic gases, including methyl isocyanate (MIC), which killed an estimated 3,787 people immediately, and another 4,000 to 5,000 in the following weeks and months. The leak also injured hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom suffered long-term health problems.\nUnion Carbide's public relations response to the disaster was widely criticized for its inadequacy and insensitivity. The company's initial response was to downplay the severity of the disaster and to blame the Indian government and local authorities for the leak.\nOn the night of the leak, December 3, 1984, the company's local manager, J. Mukund, was alerted to the leak by a plant employee, but he did not take immediate action to evacuate the surrounding area. Instead, he called the local police and government officials, who were slow to respond.\nThe next morning, December 4, Union Carbide's CEO, Warren Anderson, flew to Bhopal, but he did not meet with local officials or visit the affected areas. Instead, he met with the Indian government's Minister of Industry, George Fernandes, and other officials, where he claimed that the leak was a \"one-time accident\" and that the company was doing everything it could to help.\nOver the next few days, Union Carbide's public relations team, led by the company's vice president of public relations, Robert Shapiro, issued a series of statements and press releases that downplayed the severity of the disaster and blamed the Indian government and local authorities for the leak.\nOn December 5, 1984, Union Carbide issued a statement saying that the leak was caused by a \"one-time accident\" and that the company was \"deeply sorry\" for the tragedy.

The scandal was widely reported and sparked a major investigation by the U.S. Senate.\nIn 2012, the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) released a report that detailed HSBC's alleged involvement in money laundering. The report found that HSBC's Mexican subsidiary, HSBC M\u00e9xico, had laundered billions of dollars for the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful and violent cartels. The report also found that HSBC had laundered money for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a leftist guerrilla group in Colombia.\nThe report found that HSBC had failed to properly monitor its Mexican subsidiary's transactions, allowing the cartel to launder billions of dollars through the bank's system. The report also found that HSBC had used a complex system of shell companies and other financial instruments to launder money for the cartel.\nOne of the key figures in the scandal was Efra\u00edn R\u00edos Montt, a former president of Guatemala who was accused of laundering money for the Sinaloa cartel through HSBC.

Guggenheim Museum in New York City was influenced by a combination of factors, including the client's requirements, the site's constraints, and Wright's own architectural philosophy. Here are some specific details and examples that shed light on the design process:\n\n**Client:**\nSolomon R. Guggenheim, a wealthy art collector and philanthropist, commissioned Wright to design a museum in New York City. Guggenheim was a friend and admirer of Wright's work, and he had previously visited Wright's famous Fallingwater house in Pennsylvania. Guggenheim wanted a museum that would showcase modern and contemporary art, and he was willing to take risks on a unconventional design.\n\n**Architect:**\nFrank Lloyd Wright was a renowned American architect who had a long history of designing innovative and organic buildings. Wright was 75 years old when he began designing the Guggenheim Museum, and he was still actively practicing architecture. He was known for his emphasis on horizontal lines, natural materials, and integration with the surrounding landscape.\n\n**Site:**\nThe museum was built on a triangular site in Manhattan's Upper East Side, bounded by 5th Avenue, 88th Street, and the Queensboro Bridge. The site was a former parking lot, and it was relatively small, measuring about 50 feet wide and 200 feet long. Wright was drawn to the site's unique geometry and its proximity to Central Park.\n\n**Design Process:**\nWright began designing the Guggenheim Museum in 1943, and he worked on the project for over a decade. He was initially inspired by the site's triangular shape and the idea of creating a spiral ramp that would wind its way through the building. Wright's design was influenced by his earlier work on the Johnson Wax Headquarters in Racine, Wisconsin, which featured a similar spiral design.\n\n**Innovative Design Features:**\n\n1. **Circular Shape:** Wright's design featured a circular shape with a diameter of 120 feet. The circle was divided into 12 equal segments, each with a 30-degree angle. The circular shape was chosen to create a sense of continuity"}, {"prompt": "What is the movie 'Argo'?

Here are some specific details and examples about this fascinating creature:\n1. **Distribution and Habitat**: The Amazonian giant centipede is found in the tropical regions of Central and South America, including countries such as Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. They inhabit areas with high humidity and temperatures, typically between 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F), and are often found in leaf litter, under rocks, and in burrows.\n2. **Physical Characteristics**: The Amazonian giant centipede is one of the largest centipedes in the world, with some specimens reaching up to 30 cm (12 in) in length and weighing up to 100 grams (3.5 oz). They have a flat, elongated body with 21 pairs of legs, each covered with sharp, hook-like spines that they use for defense and catching prey.\n3. **Behavior and Diet**: Amazonian giant centipedes are nocturnal predators that feed on small animals, such as insects, worms, and even small vertebrates like lizards and frogs. They use their sharp spines and powerful jaws to catch and kill their prey, and are known to be formidable hunters.\n4. **Reproduction**: Amazonian giant centipedes breed in the wet season, typically between March and May, and females lay up to 50 eggs in a burrow or under a rock. The eggs hatch after about 2-3 weeks, and the young centipedes go through several molts before reaching adulthood.\n5. **Conservation Status**: The Amazonian giant centipede is not considered to be a threatened species, although its habitat is being threatened by deforestation and other human activities.\n6. **Interesting Facts**: Amazonian giant centipedes are known to be able to regrow lost legs, and have even been observed to autotomize (self-amputate) their legs to escape from predators.

Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.)?\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of telescopes that work together to form a virtual Earth-sized telescope, allowing scientists to study the environment around black holes in unprecedented detail. The EHT project was initiated in 2006 by Shep Doeleman, a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and has since grown to include over 200 researchers from around the world.\n\nThe EHT uses a technique called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to combine the signals from multiple telescopes, effectively creating a single telescope with a diameter of about 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles). This allows the EHT to achieve resolutions of about 20 microarcseconds, which is equivalent to being able to see a dime on the surface of the Moon.\n\nThe EHT has made several groundbreaking discoveries, including the first-ever image of a black hole, which was released in 2019. The image shows the black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, which is located about 55 million light-years away from Earth. The black hole has a mass of approximately 6.5 billion times that of the sun and is surrounded by a disk of hot, glowing gas.\n\nThe EHT has also made observations of the black hole at the center of the galaxy Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which is located about 26,000 light-years away from Earth. The EHT has observed the black hole's shadow, which is the dark region around the black hole where the light is too bright to escape.\n\nThe EHT has also studied the environment around black holes, including the accretion disk, which is the disk of hot, glowing gas that surrounds the black hole. The EHT has made observations of the accretion disk's temperature and density, which have helped scientists understand how black holes interact with their surroundings.\n\nThe EHT has also made observations of the magnetic field around black holes, which is thought to play a crucial role in the formation of stars and planets. The EHT has observed the magnetic field's strength and structure, which has helped scientists understand how black holes influence their surroundings.\n\nThe EHT has also studied the black hole's event horizon, which is the point of no return around a black hole.

King was 39 years old at the time of his death.\nJames Earl Ray was a 40-year-old escaped convict from Missouri who had a history of violent behavior. He had been living in Memphis for several weeks prior to the assassination, using various aliases and renting rooms under false names. Ray had become increasingly obsessed with King and his message, and he saw the civil rights leader as a threat to white supremacy.\nOn the day of the assassination, King had arrived in Memphis to support the city's African American sanitation workers, who were on strike to protest poor working conditions and low wages. King had planned to lead a march in support of the workers, but he had decided to cancel the march and instead speak to the workers at the Mason Temple.\nAt around 6:00 p.m., King stepped out onto the balcony of the Lorraine Motel, where he was staying, to take in some fresh air. He was standing on the balcony with several of his associates, including Ralph Abernathy and Andrew Young. As King stood on the balcony, James Earl Ray fired a single shot from a Remington 760 rifle from a nearby rooming house. The bullet struck King in the jaw and exited through his neck, causing massive bleeding and damage to his spinal cord.\nKing was rushed to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. The hospital was quickly surrounded by a large crowd of protesters and reporters, and the news of King's death spread quickly through the city.\nJames Earl Ray fled the scene immediately after the shooting, leaving behind a Remington 760 rifle and a pair of binoculars. He abandoned his car, a white Mustang, near the rooming house from which he had fired the shot, and he escaped into the woods. Ray spent the next several days on the run, using various aliases and disguises to evade capture.\nOn June 8, 1968, James Earl Ray was arrested at London's Heathrow Airport, where he was attempting to leave the country."}, {"prompt": "Can you outline the approach of GoPro's \"Be a Hero\" marketing campaign?

On September 16, 2007, a group of Blackwater Worldwide security contractors, employed by the US State Department, opened fire on civilians in a crowded square in Baghdad's Nisour neighborhood, killing 17 people and wounding 20 others.\nThe incident began when a convoy of Blackwater contractors, led by Paul Slough, was traveling through the square when a driver in a civilian vehicle, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed, allegedly tried to cut off the convoy. The Blackwater guards, who were traveling in a heavily armored vehicle, became agitated and began to fire their guns, reportedly without warning or provocation. The shooting continued for several minutes, with the Blackwater contractors firing at civilians who were trying to flee the scene.\nThe incident was widely condemned by Iraqi officials, who accused the Blackwater contractors of committing a massacre. The Iraqi government demanded that the US government take action against the contractors and the company, but the US government initially defended the actions of the Blackwater guards, claiming that they had been fired upon and were acting in self-defense.\nHowever, an investigation by the Iraqi government and the US military found that the Blackwater contractors had acted unilaterally and without provocation, and that many of the civilians killed or wounded were innocent bystanders. The investigation also found that the Blackwater contractors had failed to follow established protocols for dealing with civilian casualties, and that they had attempted to cover up their actions by falsifying reports and intimidating witnesses.\n\nSome of the specific details and examples of the controversy surrounding the Blackwater shootings include:\n\n* On September 16, 2007, at around 10:00 am, a group of Blackwater contractors, including Paul Slough, Jeremy Ridgeway, and Dustin Heard, were traveling through Nisour Square in Baghdad in a convoy of heavily armored vehicles.\n* The convoy was traveling at high speed and was reportedly driven by a Blackwater contractor named Paul Slough.\n* A civilian vehicle, driven by Ahmed Haithem Ahmed, allegedly tried to cut off the convoy, which led to the Blackwater"}, {"prompt": "What is the computer security company FireEye?

The film stars Liam Neeson as Schindler and Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, his accountant.\nThe movie begins in 1939, when Germany invades Poland, and Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, arrives in Krakow to start a business. He is initially motivated by a desire to profit from the war, but as he witnesses the atrocities committed by the Nazis, he begins to question his actions.\nSchindler meets Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant who helps him establish a factory in Krakow. Schindler hires many Jewish workers, including a young girl named Poldek Pfefferberg, who later becomes a key figure in Schindler's efforts to save his workers.\nAs the war escalates, Schindler becomes increasingly involved in the lives of his workers, learning about their families and personal struggles. He also becomes aware of the Nazis' plan to liquidate the Krakow Ghetto, and he decides to take action.\nSchindler uses his connections with high-ranking Nazi officials to obtain a list of his workers, which he claims are essential to his factory's production. He also bribes officials to allow him to keep his workers, who are eventually relocated to a concentration camp in Czechoslovakia.\nThe film depicts the brutal conditions in the concentration camps, including the use of gas chambers and mass executions. Schindler's efforts to save his workers are hindered by the Nazis, who are determined to eliminate all Jews from Poland.\nDespite the obstacles, Schindler continues to work tirelessly to save his workers, using his connections and bribes to keep them safe. He also works with other members of the resistance, including a group of Polish workers who help him smuggle Jews out of the concentration camp.\nThe film's climax takes place in 1945, when Soviet troops liberate the concentration camp where Schindler's workers are being held.
