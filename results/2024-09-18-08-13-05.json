Provide as many specific details and examples as possible (such as names of people, numbers, events, locations, dates, times, etc.) on his life, philosophy, and influence.\nJacques Derrida (1930-2004) was a French philosopher known for his work in deconstruction, a critical method used to analyze and challenge traditional notions of meaning, language, and reality. Born in El Biar, Algeria, on July 15, 1930, Derrida grew up in a Jewish family and was educated in French and Arabic. He studied philosophy at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) in Paris, where he earned his agr\u00e9gation in philosophy in 1954.\n\nDerrida's academic career began as a professor of philosophy at the ENS, where he taught from 1959 to 1984. He also taught at various other institutions, including the University of Vincennes (now the University of Paris VIII) and the University of California, Irvine. In 1986, he became a professor of humanities at the University of California, Irvine, where he taught until his death in 2004.\n\nDerrida's philosophical work focused on the critique of Western philosophy, particularly the ideas of Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, and Edmund Husserl. He is known for his concept of \"diff\u00e9rance,\" which challenges the traditional notion of meaning as a fixed, stable concept. Instead, Derrida argued that meaning is always in a state of flux, constantly deferred and subject to reinterpretation.\n\nOne of Derrida's most influential works is \"Of Grammatology\" (1967), which critiques the traditional notion of language as a transparent medium for conveying meaning. He argues that language is inherently ambiguous and that meaning is always subject to multiple interpretations. In this work, Derrida also critiques the ideas of Ferdinand de Saussure, the founder of structural linguistics, and argues that Saussure's concept of the \"signifier\" is too narrow and fails to account for the complexities of language.\n\nAnother key work by Derrida is \"Writing and Difference\" (1967), which explores the relationship between writing and speech. He argues that writing is not simply a secondary form of communication, but rather a fundamental aspect of human language. In this work, Derrida also critiques the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, arguing that their notions of language and reality are too narrow and fail to account for the complexities of human experience.\n\nDerrida's influence extends far beyond the academic world. His ideas have had a significant impact on various fields, including literary theory, cultural studies, and philosophy. Many notable thinkers, including Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Gilles Deleuze, and Judith Butler, have been influenced by Derrida's work.\n\nSome notable events and dates in Derrida's life include:\n\n* 1949: Derrida begins studying philosophy at the ENS in Paris.\n* 1954: Derrida earns his agr\u00e9gation in philosophy.\n* 1959: Derrida becomes a professor of philosophy at the ENS.\n* 1967: Derrida publishes \"Of Grammatology\" and \"Writing and Difference.\"\n* 1986: Derrida becomes a professor of humanities at the University of California, Irvine.\n* 1997: Derrida delivers a series of lectures on the concept of \"spectrality\" at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nSome notable people who have been influenced by Derrida's work include:\n\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard: A French philosopher and sociologist who was a key figure in the development of postmodern thought.\n* Gilles Deleuze: A French philosopher who was known for his work on desire, power, and identity.\n* Judith Butler: An American philosopher and cultural critic who has been influenced by Derrida's work on gender and sexuality.\n* Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak: An Indian philosopher and literary critic who has been influenced by Derrida's work on postcolonialism and feminism.\n* Jacques Lacan: A French psychoanalyst who was influenced by Derrida's work on the relationship between language and the unconscious.\n\nSome notable events and movements that have been influenced by Derrida's work include:\n\n* The French May 1968 student uprising: Derrida's ideas on the critique of Western philosophy and the importance of challenging traditional notions of meaning and reality were influential in the student movement.\n* The postmodern movement: Derrida's work on deconstruction and the critique of traditional notions of meaning and reality was influential in the development of postmodern thought.\n* The feminist movement: Derrida's work on the relationship between language and gender was influential in the development of feminist theory.\n* The postcolonial movement: Derrida's work on the relationship between language and colonialism was influential in the development of postcolonial theory.\n\nSome notable locations"}, {"prompt": "What is the goal of Project Implicit, an online research project on implicit social cognition?
